# Gm, I'm Alexis 👋

I'm currently...

- building with Claude Code — no coding background, first time in my life
  I feel like I have superpowers
- training for a marathon (send help)
- researching DeFi protocols and writing what I find on Substack
- drinking too much coffee somewhere in Thailand
- going down YouTube rabbit holes I have no business being in

I'm excited about...

- the idea that curiosity compounds — research → alpha → products → repeat
- experiences that hit every sense at once. I can't walk into a room without
  thinking about how it could be better
- Ethereum's values and why they still matter after all this noise
- connecting people in ways they'll remember for the rest of their lives
- building tools I actually want to exist

I'm obsessed with motion.

Running clears my head. Music moves my body. Claude moves my ideas forward.
Everything I care about — training, building, researching — is just different
forms of the same thing: keep movinge what happens.

If any of that resonates, reach out.

I want to meet people who are genuine, funny, and a little unapologetic.
High-agency. Sporty. Honest about their fears as much as their wins.
Weird over boring. Every single time.
