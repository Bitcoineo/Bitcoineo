# Gm, I'm Bitcoineo 👋

I'm currently...

- building with Claude Code. no coding background, first time in my life
  I feel like I have superpowers
- training for a marathon (send help)
- researching defi protocols and writing what I find on Twitter
- drinking too much coffee somewhere in Thailand
- going down YouTube rabbit holes I have no business being in

I'm excited about...

- curiosity compounding. research → alpha → products → repeat
- experiences that hit every sense at once
- ethereum's values and why they still matter after all this noise
- building tools I actually want to exist

So I build them.

I track my habits with [Streaks](https://github.com/Bitcoineo/streaks).
I train with [Marathon Tracker](https://github.com/Bitcoineo/marathonTracker).
I monitor my Claude usage with [this extension](https://github.com/Bitcoineo/claudeUsageExtension) I built because I was curious.
I research DeFi with an [agent I wrote](https://github.com/Bitcoineo/liveResearchAgendoes the boring parts for me.
And when ETH gas spikes, my [Gas Tracker](https://github.com/Bitcoineo/gasTrackerExtension) tells me before I even check.

I'm obsessed with motion.

Running clears my head. Music moves my body. Claude moves my ideas forward.
Training, building, researching, it's all the same thing:
keep moving, don't stop, see what happens.

If any of that resonates, reach out.

Weird over boring. Every single time.
