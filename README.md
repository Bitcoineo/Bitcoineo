# Gm, I'm Bitcoineo 👋

I'm currently...

- building with Claude Code. no coding background, first time in my life
  I feel like I have superpowers
- training for a marathon (send help)
- researching DeFi protocols and writing what I find on Substack
- drinking too much coffee somewhere in Thailand
- going down YouTube rabbit holes I have no business being in

I'm excited about...

- curiosity compounding. research → alpha → products → repeat
- experiences that hit every sense at once
- Ethereum's values and why they still matter after all this noise
- building tools I actually want to exist

I'm obsessed with motion.

Running clears my head. Music moves my body. Claude moves my ideas forward.
Training, building, researching, it's all the same thing:
keep moving, don't stop, see what happens.

If any of that resonates, reach out.

Weird over boring. Every single time.
